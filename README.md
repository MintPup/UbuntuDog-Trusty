MintPup-Trusty is a fork of DebianDog based on Linux Mint 17.1 and Ubuntu-Trusty

This version will be developed for my own needs only. If you still can find here something useful I'm glad.
But if you like to change it or develop it in different direction, please - make your own fork.

The project started by **wanderer** in [this thread.](http://murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=99909) 

[**Credits and contributors list.**](https://github.com/DebianDog/Wheezy/blob/master/Credits.md)

MintPup is small 32-bit Ubuntu/Mint based live CD shaped to look and act like Puppy Linux. Ubuntu structure and Ubuntu behaviour are untouched and Ubuntu/Mint documentation is valid for MintPup. You have access to all Ubuntu/Mint repositories using apt-get or synaptic.
